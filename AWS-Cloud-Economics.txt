Cloud Economics => Business value + Cloud financial management

Objectives of AWS Cloud Economics
- Identifying 2 main areas of cloud economics (Business Value TCO and Cloud financial mgmt)
- Concept of business value in cloud economics
- 4 pillars involved in Cloud Value Framework
- Example of value realized by migrating to AWS

Business Value - discussion with customer to improve Business value
Cloud financial mgmnt - financial managing tools and benefits for customer

Why cloud economics (Business value evaluation with business case demo)
- Increases win rates (Greater win rate)
- Grow deal size (Greater revenue growth)
- Accelerate sales cycle (20 days Faster sales cycle)
- Eliminates uncertainty about finance

Business value evaluation
Values are delivered by:
Conversation --> analysis --> full value (X)
Proofs of concept -> Architectural reviews -> Migration of workloads (correct)

Purpose of analysis -> case of point where cust are satisfied

Cloud value framework
- Cost savings (TCO)
- Staff productivity
- Operational resilience
- Business agility

Cloud Value Framework : Cost Savings
- Cost savings (TCO) - important - how much they use using traditional approach while how much they use using AWS
- Staff Productivity - relieves resources - 
- Operational resilience - more uptime and less downtime
- Business Agility - Respond faster

Cost saving analysis - compare cost and check how much they will need to develop business case (Calculates total cost of analysis and ownership)
- calculates total cost of ownership acquisition and operating cost

Lower costs with AWS (reserved and spot instances)
- Using comsumption-based model => pay what you use
- AWS pricing models => Purchase order(PO) -> sends to department -> Overprovision/ Underprovision (inefficiency and financial losses) which is NOT in AWS
- Frequent price reductions -> AWS pricing models -> Maturity = enough data, behavior , on-demand instances -> reserved instances reduce cost by 75%
spot-instance, dedicated hosts, Increase efficiency and reduce costs, S3 glaciers
- AWS reduces costs over long term
- ROI 

Amazon flywheel -> Lower prices, increases infra - low infra costs, economy of scale

Cloud economics model example
- Capital investment -> defining purchase cycle
- Provisioning infra

Migration Challenges => moves existing footprint to cloud
-> Costs - sunk infra costs, cost of migration and decommissioning
Formula => cost savings / (sunk costs + migration costs) = ROI
Sunk cost => Depreciation (selling data centre to other compamy for operations) + recovery value (Can't sell data centre - no recovery value)

Migration costs => MPA Tool used for cost analysis

Cloud readiness
- Human factor + applications are evaluated

App readiness questions
- what are your app dependencies ?
- What apps are communicating with other apps?
- What apps can be translated easily ?

Entrenched IT department - IT org feels threatened by precerived loss of control or potential staff reductions
Stakeholders - decision makers/team
Cost savings engagement may require multiple discussions with dofferent messages for different audiences: Application developer(DevOps), IT support team, Procurement team, CFO/CIO/Investors. 

Cost saving analysis discussions
- Involves hardware, software and services

Traditional IT - capex, long planning cycles, multiple components

Perceived IT costs -> server costs, storage, network, IT labor cpsts, extra(planning, advisors, legal, contractors, managed services, training, cost of capital)

Customer cost savings analysis best practises
- Works => involve all stakeholders, work collaboratively with customers, use realistic usage percentages, assign cost/value to 
business-value factors such as agility and risks
- Does not work => focus purely on pricing and discounts, rather than cost analysis, compare a duplicate of an on-premises envi - problematic apples-to-apples comparision of machines, allow all decisions and vision to be based on an unchecked cost analysis, and fail to capture the true costs of IT, data center and on-premises,bring the cost savings discussion late in the decision-making process

Engagement process full assessmment
Kickoff => Cost savings overview, Timeline, scope and roles
Data collection => 2-4 weeks
Initial assessment => Review data, Initial assessment, ID open questions, assumptions
Q&A => 1 week
Full assessment => Incorporate new data, repeat as needed
Iterate and finalize => 1 week
Customer report out

TSO Logic
On-premises analysis and cloud planning 
=> automated agentless data discovery or flat file ingest
=> Identifies on-premises compute, attached storage, memory and Microsoft licenses
=> Evaluates multiple future-state scenarios based on location, purchase type, utilization and other inputs
=> Right-sizes overprovisioned resources to realize historically validated savings
=> Available to partners that meet certain qualifications

Examples of value realized
- Cost saving - samsung reduced $34 million capex
- Staff productivity - AdRoll reduced $3 million in staffing costs
- Operational resilience - MedStar Health reduced downtime from 2 hrs to less than 5 min per month
- Business Agility - Aon Reduced cal and reporting time from 10 days to 10 minutes
