on-premises IT - servers, storage, databases, applications, corporate network

Cloud computing is on-demand delivery of computing power, database storage, applications and other IT resources via the internet - pay as you go.

Benefits of cloud computing
- agility, elasticity, cost savings, deploy globally in minutes
- fault tolerance and high availability

Products -> analytics, compute, storage, networking, management tools, mobile, databases, security, IoT etc

AWS Management Console / software development skill (User mgmt console) 
- Media services, databases, storage, cost mgmnt, security, containers, computer, ML (200 services, 27 regions)

Region is made of 3-4 availability zones -> made of datacenters
regions -> availability zones -> datacenters (share low latency and connectivity but are independent of each other)

Local  zones - extension of regions, 
wavelength zones - internet connectivity between 5G, 
Direct connect locations , 
Edge locations - cloud front service for content distribution, 
Regional edge caches - larger version of edge locations

CORE Components
- compute, storage, database, security, managment, networking

1. Compute (EC2, AMIs and Loadbalancer) => develop, deploy, run and scale workloads in the AWS Cloud
- Resize compute capacity, EC2 instance Elastic compute cloud a virtual machine
- Auto scaling, increase or decrease number of instances
- Elastic Load Balancing, distribute incoming traffic
- Run applications on a managed cluster
- Run Kubernetes app on AWS and on premises
- AWS Lambda, Run code in response to events

Benefits of Amazon EC2 => general purpose,Compute optimized, memory optimized, accelerated computing, storage optimized
- Elasticity (increase/decrease demand)
- Control over instance (Start/stop/reboot/terminate)
- Flexibility (compute optimized) - c5d.large, c5d.xlarge, 2xlarge.... vCPUs
- Integrated
- Reliable
- Secure
- Cost-effective
- Easy

Amazon Machine Images (AMI), AWS marketplace(buy resources of aws like instance image), Community AMIs (image created by individual, risky-security)
purpose of AMIs - machine image had Operating system and other applications required

Amazon ELB - Elastic Load Balancing
- distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances
- Increases availability and fault tolerance
- configure health checks
- Offload encryption and decryption

2. Storage services - reliable, scalable and secure place for data
- Elastic Block Storage (EBS) = persistent block-level storage (kinda hardrive)
- Simple Storage Service (S3) - storage classes = durable, scalable object, versatile, used for datalakes, backup and storage, app hosting, media hosting, software delivery
(S3 standard - expensive, S3 standard infrequent access, infrequent access, storage classes)
***intelligent-tiring automatically moves objects between tiers based on access patterns (very cost efficient)
- Storage Glacier (Cheapest)  = data archiving and backup (don't store what you need immediately)
- Storage Gateway = integrate cloud storage with on-site workloads
- Elastic File System = File storage for amazon EC2 instances
- FSx = widely-used file systems

- Amazon EBS provides block storage for instances (permanent)
- Amazon S3 provides highly available object storage (everything else - website, content distribution, data leak for analytics - more general purpose storage)
- Amazon S3 offers several tiers, including amazon glacier, to better align with different storage scenarios

3.Database Services
- Relational db service - cost-efficient and resizable capacity (Postgresql , mysql, mariadb, Amazon AURORA - very efficient (6 total))
- DynamoDB - fast and predictable performance (amazon redshift, documentsDB(mongoDB), neptune, QLDB)
- ElastiCache - fast, managed info retrieval

Database Migration Service - Migrate relational databases, nonrelational databases and other types of data stores

4. Security across regions, availability zones, edge locations is responsibility of cloud
customer data is responsibility of customer

AWS Identity and access management (IAM)
- fine-grained access control to aws resources
- multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- ability to analyze access
- Integration with corporate directories

AWS Cloud compliance => Artifact reports + artifact agreements

5. AWS management interface -> mangement console, AWS Command Line Interface, Software development kits

6. NEtworking- VPN, App/web servers, load balancers, databases

Module 3 - AWS solutions
ML, analytics and data lakes, IoT, serverless computing, containers, enterprise app, storage and windows workloads

Migration Strategies (seven R's) - replatform, migration functionality and optimize components
- Rehost - lift and shift, recreating on-premises network, only hosted on AWS, automating with tools such as web/app migration
- Relocate - hypervisor-level lift and shift, migration specific to VMWare cloud on AWS
- Replatform - lift, tinker and shift, making targeted aws cloud optimizations, making targeted aws cloud optimization
- Refactor - modernize, re-imagining how the app is architected and developed, using cloud-native features like containers and serverless
- retire - shutting-off
- retain/revisit - keeping certain app on-premises
- repurchase - moving workflows to SaaS

Cloud architecture best practices
- design for failure and nothing fails (use multiple EC2 instances)
- Build security in every layer (encrypt data at rest and in transit, configure security groups)
- leverage different storage options (move static web assets to amazon s3, amazon cloudfront to serve globally, store session state in amazon dynamoDB)
- Implement elasticity (implement autoscaling policies, architect resiliency to reboot and relunch, leverage managed services like amazon s3 and amazon dynamoDB)
- Think parallel (scale horizontally not vertically, decouple compute from session/state, use elastic load balancing)
- Loose coupling sets you free (use multiple queues, use existing services)
- Do not fear constraints 

The well-architected framework
Six-pillars
- Operational excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance efficiency
- Cost optimization
- Sustainability

AWS Cloud Adoption Framework , AWS quick starts (Foundational security best practices)

Key phases of presenting -> Discovery, Presenting the solution, Delivering a POC

Objection handling best practices
- data-driven approach, Use case studies, Dive deep, have backbone, keep the momentum going

Migration and beyond (Criteria of migration)
- MVP(minimum viable product), well-architected review
- Migration process consists of 3 phase - assessment(identify readiness), readiness and planning(analyze environment, determine migration strategies),
migration and modernization (design, migrate and validated each application, automatic or manual, migrate data, modernize)

Containers (Use cases)
- Microservices, batch processing, machine learning, hybrid app, app migration to the cloud, PaaS

Serverless
- compute = ;ambda, lambda@edge, fargate
- storage = amazon s3, amazon EFS
- data stores = DynamoDB, Amazon Aurora serverless
- API proxy = amazon API Gateway
- Application Integration

Data lakes and analytics solutions on AWS
- Interactive analytics, Big data processing, data warehousing etc
