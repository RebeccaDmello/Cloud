on-premises IT - servers, storage, databases, applications, corporate network

Cloud computing is on-demand delivery of computing power, database storage, applications and other IT resources via the internet - pay as you go.

Benefits of cloud computing
- agility, elasticity, cost savings, deploy globally in minutes
- fault tolerance and high availability

Products -> analytics, compute, storage, networking, management tools, mobile, databases, security, IoT etc

AWS Management Console / software development skill (User mgmt console) 
- Media services, databases, storage, cost mgmnt, security, containers, computer, ML (200 services, 27 regions)

Region is made of 3-4 availability zones -> made of datacenters
regions -> availability zones -> datacenters (share low latency and connectivity but are independent of each other)

Local  zones - extension of regions, 
wavelength zones - internet connectivity between 5G, 
Direct connect locations , 
Edge locations - cloud front service for content distribution, 
Regional edge caches - larger version of edge locations

CORE Components
- compute, storage, database, security, managment, networking

Compute => develop, deploy, run and scale workloads in the AWS Cloud
- Resize compute capacity, EC2 instance Elastic compute cloud a virtual machine
- Auto scaling, increase or decrease number of instances
- Elastic Load Balancing, distribute incoming traffic
- Run applications on a managed cluster
- Run Kubernetes app on AWS and on premises
- AWS Lambda, Run code in response to events

Benefits of Amazon EC2
- Elasticity (increase/decrease demand)
- Control over instance (Start/stop/reboot/terminate)
- Flexibility (compute optimized) - c5d.large, c5d.xlarge, 2xlarge.... vCPUs
- Integrated
- Reliable
- Secure
