on-premises IT - servers, storage, databases, applications, corporate network

Cloud computing is on-demand delivery of computing power, database storage, applications and other IT resources via the internet - pay as you go.

Benefits of cloud computing
- agility, elasticity, cost savings, deploy globally in minutes
- fault tolerance and high availability

Products -> analytics, compute, storage, networking, management tools, mobile, databases, security, IoT etc

AWS Management Console / software development skill (User mgmt console) 
- Media services, databases, storage, cost mgmnt, security, containers, computer, ML (200 services, 27 regions)

Region is made of 3-4 availability zones -> made of datacenters
regions -> availability zones -> datacenters (share low latency and connectivity but are independent of each other)

Local  zones - extension of regions, 
wavelength zones - internet connectivity between 5G, 
Direct connect locations , 
Edge locations - cloud front service for content distribution, 
Regional edge caches - larger version of edge locations

CORE Components
- compute, storage, database, security, managment, networking

1. Compute (EC2, AMIs and Loadbalancer) => develop, deploy, run and scale workloads in the AWS Cloud
- Resize compute capacity, EC2 instance Elastic compute cloud a virtual machine
- Auto scaling, increase or decrease number of instances
- Elastic Load Balancing, distribute incoming traffic
- Run applications on a managed cluster
- Run Kubernetes app on AWS and on premises
- AWS Lambda, Run code in response to events

Benefits of Amazon EC2 => general purpose,Compute optimized, memory optimized, accelerated computing, storage optimized
- Elasticity (increase/decrease demand)
- Control over instance (Start/stop/reboot/terminate)
- Flexibility (compute optimized) - c5d.large, c5d.xlarge, 2xlarge.... vCPUs
- Integrated
- Reliable
- Secure
- Cost-effective
- Easy

Amazon Machine Images (AMI), AWS marketplace(buy resources of aws like instance image), Community AMIs (image created by individual, risky-security)
purpose of AMIs - machine image had Operating system and other applications required

Amazon ELB - Elastic Load Balancing
- distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances
- Increases availability and fault tolerance
- configure health checks
- Offload encryption and decryption

2. Storage services - reliable, scalable and secure place for data
- Elastic Block Storage (EBS) = persistent block-level storage (kinda hardrive)
- Simple Storage Service (S3) - storage classes = durable, scalable object, versatile, used for datalakes, backup and storage, app hosting, media hosting, software delivery
(S3 standard - expensive, S3 standard infrequent access, infrequent access, storage classes)
***intelligent-tiring automatically moves objects between tiers based on access patterns (very cost efficient)
- Storage Glacier (Cheapest)  = data archiving and backup (don't store what you need immediately)
- Storage Gateway = integrate cloud storage with on-site workloads
- Elastic File System = File storage for amazon EC2 instances
- FSx = widely-used file systems

- Amazon EBS provides block storage for instances (permanent)
- Amazon S3 provides highly available object storage (everything else - website, content distribution, data leak for analytics - more general purpose storage)
- Amazon S3 offers several tiers, including amazon glacier, to better align with different storage scenarios
