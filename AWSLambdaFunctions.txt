AWS Lambda Functions
= Handler method -> An entry point that AWS Lambda calls to initiate your lambda function
= Context object -> This is generated by AWS and provides metadata about the action
= Event object -> An object with info about the event that initiated the lambda function

Building Lambda functions can be done in 3 ways: Console editor, deployment packages and automation tools
1. Lambda console editor
2. Deployment packages
3. Automation tools

Best purpose for authoring using AWS management console?
-> Simple one-function applications with no custom libraries and experimentation

- When you create a Lambda function, only one version exists: the $LATEST version
- You can reference any version with an alias
- You can reference a version or an alias in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
